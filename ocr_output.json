{"text":"The Three Questions\nLeo Tolstoy\n\nUpbeat\n\nV.2,n. 10, 1969\n\n(Three Questions was written for a publication intended to raise funds for the victims of\nan anti-Jewish pogrom in Kishinev. Tolstoy had written an open letter to the tsar\naccusing his government of being directly responsible for the massacre.)\n\nWhen is the right time?\nWho are the right people?\nWhat is the most important thing to do?\n\nIt once occurred to a certain king that if he always knew just when to undertake\neverything he did, and which were the right and which the wrong people to deal with,\nand, above all, if he always knew what was the most important thing to do, he would\nnever fail in anything.\n\nHaving thus thought, the king proclaimed throughout his realm that he would bestow a\nlarge reward on anyone who would teach him how to know the proper moment for every\ndeed, how to know which were the most essential people, and how not to err in deciding\nwhich pursuits were of the greatest importance. Learned men began coming to the king,\nbut they all gave different answers to his questions.\n\nIn reply to the first question some said that in order to know the right time for every\naction one must draw up a schedule of days, months, and years, and strictly adhere to it.\nOnly in this way, they said, could everything be done at the proper time.\n\nOthers said it was not possible to decide in advance what to do and when to do it; that\none must not allow himself to be distracted by vain amusements, but must be attentive to\neverything that happens and do whatever is required.\n\nA third group said that no matter how attentive the king might be to what was going on, it\nwas impossible for one man rightly to decide the time for every action, and that he ought\nto have a council of wise men, and act according to their advice.\n\nA fourth group said that there were certain matters which required immediate decision,\nleaving no time to determine by means of consultation whether or not it was the right\ntime to undertake them. In order to know this, one would have to know in advance what\nwas going to happen, which is something that only a magician can know; therefore, in\norder to know the right time for every action, one must consult the magicians.\n\nThe answers to the second question also varied. Some said that the people the king most\nneeded were his administrators; some said the priests, and some the physicians, while\nothers said the warriors were the most essential.\n\nThe answers to the third question, as to what was the most important pursuit, were\nequally diverse. Some said that science was the most important thing in the world, some\nsaid military skill, and others religious worship. The answers were all different, therefore\nthe king agreed with none of them and rewarded no one.\n\nIn order to find the true answer to the questions, he decided to consult a hermit who was\nfamous for his wisdom. The hermit never left the forest where he lived, and there he\nreceived none but simple folk. The king therefore dressed himself as one of the people,\nand dismounting before he reached the hermit’s dwelling, he left his knights behind and\nwent on alone.\n\nThe king found the hermit digging a garden in front of his hut. When he saw the king,\nthe hermit greeted him and immediately returned to his digging. He was think and frail,\nand each time he thrust his spade into the ground and tumed a little clod of earth, he\nbreathed heavily.\n\nThe king approached him and said: “I have come to you, wise hermit, to ask you for the\nanswers to three questions: How can I know which is the time I ought to heed, not\nallowing it to slip by only to be regretted later? Who are the most essential people, those\nto whom I ought to give the greatest attention? And what are the most important\npursuits, which therefore ought to be undertaken first?”\n\nThe hermit listened to the king, but gave him no answer; he merely spat on his hands and\nstarted digging again.\n\n“Y ou have exhausted yourself,” the king said. “Give me the spade. I’ll work fora\nwhile.” “Thanks,” said the hermit. He handed him the spade and sat down on the\nground. After digging two beds, the king stopped and repeated his question. The hermit\ndid not answer, but got up and held out his hand for the spade, saying: “No you rest and\nI'll work.” But the king did not give him the space; he went on digging.\n\nAn hour passed, then another; the sun had begun to sink behind the trees when the king\nstuck the spade into the ground and said: “I came to you, wise man, for answers to my\nquestions. If you can give me none, tell me so and J shall return home.”\n\n“Here comes someone running,” said the hermit. “Let us see who it is.”\n\nThe king looked around and saw a bearded man running out of the woods. The man held\nhis hands pressed to his stomach and blood flowed from between his fingers. He ran up\nto the king and fell fainting to the ground, where he lay motionless, weakly moaning.\n\nThe king and the hermit opened the man’s clothing. There was a large wound in his\nstomach. The king washed it as well as he could and bandaged it with his own\nhandkerchief and the hermit’s towel; but the flow of blood did not abate. Again and\nagain the king removed the bandage soaked with warm blood, washed it, and rebandaged\nthe wound. When the blood at least ceased flowing, the wounded man revived and asked\nfor water. The king brought fresh water and gave him a drink.\n\nMeanwhile the sun had set and it grew cool. The king, with the hermit’s help, carried the\nwounded man into the hut and laid him on the bed. He closed his eyes and grew still.\nThe king was so tired from his walk and the work he had done that he lay down on the\nthreshold and fell asleep. And he slept so soundly through the short summer night that\nwhen he woke up in the morning it was some time before he realized where he was and\nrecalled the bearded stranger lying on the bed, who was now gazing intently at him with\nluminous eyes.\n\n“Forgive me,” said the bearded man in a faint voice, when he saw that the king was\nawake and looking at him.\n\n“T do not know you and have nothing to forgive you,” replied the king.\n\n“Y ou do not know me, but I know you. I am your enemy, and I swore to take vengeance\non you for killing my brother and seizing my property. I knew you had come alone to\nsee the hermit, and I resolved to kill you on your way back. But when the whole day\npassed and you did not return, I left my ambush to seek you out, and came upon your\nknights instead. They recognized me, fell upon me, and wounded me. | escaped from\nthem, but I should have bled to death if you had not cared for my wound. I intended to\nkill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you\nas your most faithful slave, and bid my sons to do the same. Forgive me!” The king was\nhappy to be so easily reconciled with his enemy, and he not only forgave him but\npromised to return his property and send his own physician and servants to attend him.\n\nHaving taken leave of the wounded man, the king went out to look for the hermit. Before\nleaving him he wished for the last time to ask him to answer his questions. The hermit\nwas on his knees in the yard sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before.\nThe king approached him and said: “For the last time, wise man, I ask you to answer my\nquestions.”\n\n“But you have already been answered,” said the hermit, squatting on his thin calves and\nlooking up at the king who stood before him. “How have I been answered?” asked the\nking.\n\n“How?” repeated the hermit. “Had you not taken pity on my weakness yesterday an ddug\nthese beds for me, instead of turning back alone, that fellow would have assaulted you,\nand you would have regretted not staying with me. Therefore, the most important time\nwas when you were digging the beds; I was the most important man; and the most\nimportant pursuit was to do good to me. And later, when that man came running to us,\nthe most important time was when you were taking care of him, for if you had not bound\nup his wounds, he would have died without having made peace with you; therefore he\nwas the most important man, and what you did for him was the most important deed.\nRemember then: there is only one important time - Now. And it is important because it\nis the only time we have dominion over ourselves; and the most important man is he with\nwhom you are, for no one can know whether or not he will ever have dealings with any\nother man; and the most important pursuit is to do good to him, since it is for that purpose\nalone that man was sent into this life.”\n\n","metadata":{"num_pages":3,"filename":"The Three Questions.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf"},"confidence":0.8639169348373003}
